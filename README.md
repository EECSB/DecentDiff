# Decent Diff

## About
I often use online diff tools to compare code snippets and text files, so I decided to make my own. I already used the Monaco editor in other projects([online C# compiler](https://github.com/EECSB/CsharpOnlineCompiler), [GDS Viewer](https://github.com/EECSB/GDSViewer), [Decent Paste](https://github.com/EECSB/DecentPaste)), so I knew it had a diff editor as well. Additionally, I already had the code to save and share the editor using [GUN.js](https://gun.js.org/)(decentralized graph database).

The account and its data are saved to the GUN.js decentralized database. **Warning: I'm not hosting a relay node, so any data you save is reliant on public nodes, which may not store your data indefinitely.** You can add additional nodes under: Gun Nodes
